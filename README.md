## `roman-mg` update:

Added teammate-tank color support for `ThreatPlates`. This feature is not configurable (since I donâ€™t want to maintain or extend this addon) and is hardcoded to the color `0.23, 0.61, 1` (blue).

If you want to change the color, replace the RGB values in` TidyPlates_ThreatPlates/Functions.lua` (use CTRL+F to find them).

Note: This functionality is not dynamically supported on older WotLK cores, and it cannot be fixed.
